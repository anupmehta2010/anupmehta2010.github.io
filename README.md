# GitPage Project

This repository contains the files for my GitPage project. The project is a simple, interactive webpage about me.

## About Me

I am a beginner, just starting my journey with Git and GitHub. I am eager to learn and looking for opportunities to grow my skills through this project.

## GitPage Folder

The GitPage folder contains various files that work together to create the webpage:

- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file for the GitPage project. It defines the structure of the webpage, including sections for my skills, social links, and tech stack.

- `styles.css`: This CSS file defines the styles for the webpage. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual elements of the webpage.

- `script.js`: This JavaScript file adds interactivity to the webpage. It includes code to change the header color on mouseover, display alerts when list items are clicked, and open social links in a new tab.

These three files are linked together to create a cohesive, interactive webpage. The HTML file includes links to the CSS and JavaScript files, allowing them to influence the structure and behavior of the webpage.

Feel free to explore these files and make any necessary modifications to suit your needs. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Happy coding!
